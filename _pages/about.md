title: Privacy and Security in ML Seminars
---

This is the homepage of the **Privacy & Security in Machine Learning (PriSec-ML) Interest Group**. It brings together researchers and practitioners around the world broadly interested in this topic. For the time being, it features recurring seminars, roughly every two weeks, tentatively Wednesdays 1pm (London Time).

**Dr. Sara Hooker (Google Brain)**  
The myth of the interpretable, robust, compact and high performance deep neural network  
[[Zoom Registration]() [[Live Stream]()<details><br>**Abstract:**<br>To-date, a discussion around the relative merits of different compression methods has centered on the trade-off between level of compression and top-line metrics. Along this dimension, compression techniques such as pruning and quantization are remarkably successful. It is possible to prune or heavily quantize with negligible decreases to test-set accuracy. However, top-line metrics obscure critical differences in generalization between compressed and non-compressed networks. In this talk, we will go beyond test-set accuracy and discuss some of my recent work measuring the trade-offs between compression, robustness and algorithmic bias. Characterizing these trade-offs provide insight into how capacity is used in deep neural networks -- the majority of parameters are used to represent a small fraction of the training set.<br><br>**Bio:**<br>[https://www.sarahooker.me](https://www.sarahooker.me))<br></details>

Adversarial Preprocessing: Image-Scaling Attacks in Machine Learning  
[[Zoom Registration](https://ucl.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEoc-itqzwoE9wIgC6gpR5WAMIWlt0dgFeB)] [[Live Stream](https://youtu.be/kCKayHjZd3E)]<details><br>**Abstract:**<br>The remarkable advances of machine learning are overshadowed by attacks that thwart its proper operation. While previous work has mainly focused on attacking learning algorithms directly, another weak spot in intelligent systems has been overlooked: preprocessing. As an example of this threat, I present a recent class of attacks against image scaling. These attacks are agnostic to learning algorithms and affect the preprocessing of all vision systems that use vulnerable implementations, including versions of TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Pillow. Based on a root-cause analysis of the vulnerabilities, I introduce novel defenses that effectively block image-scaling attacks in practice and can be easily added to existing systems.<br><br>**Bio:**<br>[https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/sec/team/rieck](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/sec/team/rieck)<br></details>

### Past Seminars
This is a reboot of the [Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk)'s interest group in Privacy and Machine Learning ([old page](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/privacy-preserving-data-analysis)). We have branched out and expanded to topics at the intersection of Security (not "just" Privacy) and Machine Learning.

You can also watch the recordings of the talks on our [YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/c/PrivacyandMachineLearningInterestGroup).
