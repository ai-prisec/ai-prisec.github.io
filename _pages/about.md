Towards Efficient Semantic Communication Systems via Deep Learning Techniques

As we enter the era of connected intelligence, a fundamental paradigm shift is necessary to meet the urgent demands for real-time communication, autonomous decision-making, and efficient distributed processing. Semantic communication is proposed in this context. In this topic, we introduce the related background knowledge of semantic communication and some semantic communication systems that have been proposed.<br><br>**Bio:** Shiyao Ma received the B.Eng degree from the Heilongjiang University, China, in 2021.

**Lin Zheng (University of Hong Kong)**  
Linear Complexity Randomized Self-attention Mechanism    
[[Recording](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1jA4y197aq?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0)] [[Slide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VJHK4Dmi0So_K3wEbjLC8A5nhjscr0Vf/view?usp=sharing)][[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.04667.pdf)]<details><br>**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is the core building block in many state-of-the-art models across various domains. It is powerful and expressive in capturing complicated and long-range dependencies within the input elements. Nevertheless, it does not scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity in terms of the sequence length. In this talk, we will first discuss current strategies on reducing the time/space complexity of attention, and then focus on RFA, a particular linear attention variant that uses random feature methods to approximate the softmax function. Finally, we introduce a novel perspective to understand the approximation bias in RFA from the perspective of self-normalized importance sampling.<br><br>**Bio:** Lin Zheng received his B.E. degree from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) and now is a Ph.D. student at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), supervised by Lingpeng Kong.

Information Bottleneck in Graph Structured Data     
[[Recording](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1XB4y1m7nR?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0)] [[Slide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o6m8QtoHnC-6i55vb_zwt3-4SGb802P1/view?usp=sharing)]<details><br>**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful to fuse information from network structure and node features. However, noise and redundancy in graph data make: 1) the prediction results lack interpretation; 2)GNNs are fragile to adversarial attacks. The theory of **information bottleneck (IB)** to can provide an effective way to optimally balances expressiveness and robustness of the learned representation of graph data. In this talk, the presenter will introduce enlightening instances in using IB to prune graph data to improve the robustness and maintain expressiveness at the same time.<br><br>**Bio:** Chenhan Zhang received B.E. degree and M.S degree from University of Wollongong and City University of Hong Kong and now is a PhD candidate at University of Technology Sydney.

BadBatch: Practical Data Poisoning Attack against Federated Learning via Manipulating Local Training Batch    
[[WeMeet Registration](https://meeting.tencent.com/dw/mD5ht1WOQQbQ)] [[Live Stream](https://meeting.tencent.com/dw/mD5ht1WOQQbQ)]<details><br>**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) as a privacy-friendly collaborative learning framework benefits machine learning powered systems and services. Despite its advantages, FL is known to be vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where the adversary controls a set of clients to poison either the local training dataset or the local model update to degrade the global model performance. Existing poisoning attacks have demonstrated vast damage to FL, but they either require strong adversarial assumption on model and dataset knowledge of a certain number of clients, or rely on optimization-based attack methods that are normally expensive in a decentralized environment. In this paper, we propose a new practical poisoning attack against FL, named BadBatch, which can be launched in realistic settings of FL and does not rely on optimization. Our key observation is that by simply manipulating the local training batch, an adversary is capable of influencing global model performance and convergence. We propose gradient-oriented and model update-oriented attack strategies that focus on increasing the stochastic error of stochastic gradient descent and forcing the model to forget learned generalization features by finding bad batches. We also theoretically analyze the error upper bound and time complexity of our attack. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on two public datasets for convex and non-convex models, and evaluate our attacks against the latest defense, i.e., Byzantine robust aggregation. Our evaluation results show that Badbatch can achieve high attack performance than existing methods in a practical FL setting, shedding light on data poisoning attacks against practical FL.<br><br>**Bio:** Yi Liu received the B.Eng. degree in Network Engineering from Heilongjiang University, Harbin, China, in 2019.
