This is a temporary page for the Privacy & Security in ML (PriSec-ML) Interest Group. 
It brings together researchers and practitioners around the world broadly interested in the topic.
For the time being, it features recurring seminars, roughly every two weeks, tentatively Wednesdays 1pm London Time.

This Interest Group is a reboot of the Turing Institute's Interest Group in Privacy & Machine Learning (https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/privacy-preserving-data-analysis).
More precisely, in September 2021, we have branched out of the Turing and expanded to Security (i.e., not only Privacy) in Machine Learning.
