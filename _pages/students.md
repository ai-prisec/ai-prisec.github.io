**Yi Liu (CityU)**  
When Virtual Reality Techniques Meet Metaverse: A Front-end Perspective    
[[WeMeet Registration](https://meeting.tencent.com/dw/mD5ht1WOQQbQ)] [[Live Stream](https://meeting.tencent.com/dw/mD5ht1WOQQbQ)]<details><br>**Abstract:**Due to the development of network communication technology, Metaverse has entered the public eye. In this context, Metaverse has become a hot research direction, and related virtual reality technologies AR/VR/MR/XR have also become a research hotspot in the industry. In this talk, I will introduce the associations and differences between AR, VR, MR, and XR from the perspective of common sense in computer graphics, as well as some existing technical problems and corresponding solutions. Finally, a method to quickly build a simple VR APP based on ThreeJS and React will be introduced.<br><br>**Bio:** Yukang Shen received the B.Eng. degree in Network Engineering from Heilongjiang University, Harbin, China, in 2020. He is now a front-end engineer at SenseTime.<br></details>

**Zhe Zhang**  **(HLJU)**
<br>Interpret Federated Learning with Shapley Values<details><br>**Abstract:** With the continuous breakthroughs in the research and application of federated learning, high-performance, complex algorithms and models generally lack the transparency of decision logic and the interpretability of results. Therefore, it is challenging to deploy federated learning technology in national defense, finance, medical care, law, and cybersecurity that require accurate decision-making. In this talk, the presenter will introduce some methods that Shapley values to explain vertical federated learning.<br>
<br>**Bios:** Zhe Zhang received the B.S. degree from the North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, in 2020. He is currently working toward a Master's Degree in Information Statistics Technology at Heilongjiang University. His research interests are mainly federated learning, semi-supervised learning, and spiking neural networks.<br> </details>
