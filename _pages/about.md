title: Security and Privacy in ML Seminars
---

This is the homepage of the **Privacy & Security in Machine Learning (PriSec-ML) Interest Group**. It brings together researchers and practitioners around the world broadly interested in this topic. For the time being, it features recurring seminars, roughly every two weeks, tentatively Wednesdays 1pm (London Time).  

This is a reboot of the [Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk)'s interest group in Privacy and Machine Learning ([old page](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/privacy-preserving-data-analysis)). We have branched out and expanded to topics at the intersection of Security (not "just" Privacy) and Machine Learning.

- 13 October 2021, 13:00 ([UK time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Seminar&iso=20211013T13&p1=136))  
**Prof. Konrad Rieck (Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig)**  
Adversarial Preprocessing: Image-Scaling Attacks in Machine Learning  
[[Zoom Registration](https://ucl.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEoc-itqzwoE9wIgC6gpR5WAMIWlt0dgFeB)] [[Live Stream](https://youtu.be/kCKayHjZd3E)]<details><br>**Abstract:**<br>The remarkable advances of machine learning are overshadowed by attacks that thwart its proper operation. While previous work has mainly focused on attacking learning algorithms directly, another weak spot in intelligent systems has been overlooked: preprocessing. As an example of this threat, I present a recent class of attacks against image scaling. These attacks are agnostic to learning algorithms and affect the preprocessing of all vision systems that use vulnerable implementations, including versions of TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Pillow. Based on a root-cause analysis of the vulnerabilities, I introduce novel defenses that effectively block image-scaling attacks in practice and can be easily added to existing systems.<br><br>**Bio:**<br>[https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/sec/team/rieck](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/sec/team/rieck)<br></details>
